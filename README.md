# Landing Page Template

## Purpose

Built a landing page to flex my CSS and SASS muscles as well as to use for future projects. I was tired of clunky UI's for my projects at home and at work and though that learning and leveraging new CSS packages would be a fun project to do during my free time.

## Requirements

## Installation

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
